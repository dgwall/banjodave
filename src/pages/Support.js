            Under Construction. Ever thought about diving into the gritty
            details of game creation or getting a sneak peek of my games,
            levels, and BanjoZine issues before they hit the public? That's
            exactly what I'll be offering to my Patreon community (Launching
            Soon). If this seems like your kind of deal, It would be sick if you
            could join us on Patreon. Until then please like, comment, follow,
            subscribe etc.
