          Hello, and welcome to BanjoDave.com. As a web and game developer, I'm
          chiseling my own niche in the vast digital landscape, carefully
          shaping and refining each pixel of my creations. I am working
          diligently to transform my corner of the internet into a thriving
          gallery of projects. The crafting process is still underway, but I
          eagerly anticipate unveiling my digital masterpieces to you. Stay
          tuned.

        <h2>0DGames</h2>
        <p>
          0DGames is the creative playground where my game development projects
          come to life. As a solo dev, I aspire to design action games defined
          by distinctive artwork, crisp controls, and gripping mechanics. Behind
          the scenes, I'm fervently curating a showcase of my projects and
          insights into my design process. Keep an eye on this space as the
          curtain prepares to rise on the world of 0DGames.

        <h2>Level Design</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the heart of my level design work, where I create maps for
          the classic games DOOM by id Software and N by Metanet Software. In
          DOOM, I mold the eerie corridors and chambers of demon-infested bases,
          striving to challenge and engage players with every unexpected turn.
          For N, I focus on constructing 2D landscapes that test players'
          agility and dynamic problem-solving skills, keeping in line with the
          game's unique blend of momentum-based gameplay and precise controls.
          My aim is to contribute meaningfully to these classic games, providing
          levels that both challenge and entertain.
