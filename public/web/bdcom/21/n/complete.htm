    <h3><a href="https://www.nmaps.net/235873" target="_blank" class="ex">XO</a></h3>

    <p><i>"I love DW40 maps. He sees N in a very different way to me. His heavily object-based mapping allows him to see potential in empty spaces, and create deeply interesting and enjoyable structures in ways nobody else does.</i></p>

    <p><i>"The top section of this map serves as a prime example of this. Creative, challenging, complex, and unique - this map was the first in a long time to make me stop and actually think "How do I do this?"</i> — _destiny^-</p>

    <div class="modals">
      <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="../img/screen-n-complete-e.png" title="Entities" style="width:100%;max-width:200px">
    </div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.nmaps.net/233789" target="_blank" class="ex">Entities</a></h3>

    <p><i>"Weird maps are vogue these days. They’re in, so to speak. It’s one thing to know the proper ways to go about making maps, but it’s another knowing how to bend the rules and twist tradition in ways which yield enjoyable and unique results. DW40 has those skills in spades, and I couldn’t think of a better example than Entities. In this joyau, DW40 brings forth some excellently placed gold, a few rambunctious enemies, and an ascent even Bear Grylls would fear. (Not to mention that sexy exit switch pillar.) Keep up the good work, DW40."</i> — Aidiera</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.nmaps.net/217940" target="_blank" class="ex">Breath</a></h3>

    <p><i>"This map is a test of memory. Some people will scream at me for featuring such a clichéd map style, but it is my favourite of this kind.</i></p>

    <p><i>"It doesn't seem too bad at first... then you start playing. Admittedly some of the gold is off and the tileset, whilst looking amazing, doesn't give you much purchase against what you are about to lock horns with.</i></p>

    <p><i>"Take your time, flex your fingers and, most importantly, hold your breath."</i> — ChrisE</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.nmaps.net/192504" target="_blank" class="ex">Caster Emerald </a></h3>

    <p><i>"We had a different retile on the homepage a while back, and this goes to show how diverse they can be. Onesevennine stated "Retiles are not fine-tuned for you like many action maps are", and that couldn't be more true. What was once a PALEMOON map - we all know how amazing they are - DW40 has turned into a completely different kettle of fish.</i></p>

    <p><i>"Sometimes you feel trapped, others you couldn't be more free, but does that really matter? It's a retile!"</i> — ChrisE</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.nmaps.net/182211" target="_blank" class="ex">Stand up construct</a></h3>

    <p><i>"Although I had to perform some very unusual jumps in this map - especially to get the six pieces of gold unter the start position - it didn't take me that long to learn and love the tricks of Stand up construct by DW40. Another great part is the drone section above you which was my personal icing on the cake. And, oh boy, how delicious this cake is.</i></p>

    <p><i>"Be fast and taste it before this feature will be pushed away by upcoming ones."</i> — Chrdrenkmann</p>

    </div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.nmaps.net/180460" target="_blank" class="ex">300</a></h3>

    <p><i>"This map by DW40 shows a good combination of aesthetics and gameplay. The tiles and the written '300' look fantastic, and the scar through Leonidas's eye is a great touch. Most of the gameplay is derived from the bottom and right hand side of the map - unfortunately the left hand side is certainly lacking in gameplay elements. Completing this level is reasonably easy, though attempting an all gold is definitely more challenging.</i></p>

    <p><i>"I suppose this review wouldn't be complete if I didn't ask the question:
    "Ninjas! What is your profession?"</i> — lord_day</p>

    <p><i>"This map was a major influence on me back in the day. It's pretentious as fuck and not really very well put together, probably (it's been aaaaaaaaaaaaaages since I've played it; this review is only happening because flag sucks large fat penis), but fuck if I didn't love that back then. In fact, this map was the direct inspiration for a specific map of mine, made for a Halloween comp a couple years back. See if you can find it!</i></p>
